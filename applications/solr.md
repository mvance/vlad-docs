<h1>Solr</h1>

Solr can be built into the system with Vlad, which uses Tomcat6 to serve the Solr application.

To view the Solr control panel go to the following page:

    http://www.drupal.local:8081/solr/

If you find a 404 error on this page then you might need to force Solr to be started. You might find that although Tomcat has started correctly it might have failed to automatically start Solr. To do this you need to go to the webapp manager page on Tomcat. This can be found at the following URL, but the root page of Tomcat will also contain a link to this page.

    http://www.drupal.local:8081/manager/html

The username and password to access the webapp manager are as follows:

- Username: tomcat
- Password: tomcat
